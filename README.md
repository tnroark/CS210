* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   * The project involved creating a program using both C++ and Python that read a given list of purchased groceries and outputted data from that list. 
* What did you do particularly well?
   * I felt I did very well in the organization of my code, as well as implementing Python into C++.
* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   * One part of my code that I could not solve was that when I user inputted something that was not a number, the code would start an unending loop of the menu. Improving this would greatly help in making sure the program does not crash, and improve the usability of the code. 
* Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
   * The most challenging part was definitely writing the histogram portion of the code. Learning more about the integration of the Python code into C++, and looking at websites to figure out what exactly the specific parts of the functions that integrated Python in C++ did helped greatly in this, and I will be using the same website to learn more in the future.
* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
   * Learning how to program with Python and C++ in a bigger project will definitely be a transferable skill.
* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   * I did this by maintaining industry standards while writing and testing.
